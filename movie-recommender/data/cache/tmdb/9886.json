On a race against time, he must avoid the assassins sent to kill him and remove the data before it, too, ends his life.", "popularity": 4.9911, "poster_path": "/iH8Jgi8qvb7pnBfI8fVGaUbyRna.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 559, "logo_path": "/eC0bWHVjnjUducyA6YFoEFqnPMC.png", "name": "TriStar Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 4253, "logo_path": "/qgFBsEmKTckDM0Fk6ZTB8RyW0Rc.png", "name": "Don Carmody Productions", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 2514, "logo_path": "/zEyrFF8Nn325PXG0Q9j7my0JqIJ.png", "name": "Alliance Films", "origin_country": "CA"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1995-05-26", "revenue": 19075720, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"english_name": "English", "iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"english_name": "Japanese", "iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "日本語"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The future's most wanted fugitive.", "title": "Johnny Mnemonic", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.759, "vote_count": 1457}
